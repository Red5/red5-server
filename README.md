## Build from Source

As of release 1.2.2 the target JDK is now JDK 11 and the Maven poms use the [toolchain plugin](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html).

To build the red5 jars, execute the following on the command line:
```sh
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install
```
This will create the jars in the "target" directory of the workspace; this will also skip the unit tests.

To package everything up in an assembly (tarball/zip):
```sh
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean package -P assemble
```
To build a milestone tarball:
```sh
mvn -Dmilestone.version=1.0.7-M1 clean package -Pmilestone
```

# Eclipse

1. Create the eclipse project files, execute this within red5-server directory.
```sh
mvn eclipse:eclipse
```
2. Import the project into Eclipse.
3. Access the right-click menu and select "Configure" and then "Convert to Maven Project".
4. Now the project will build automatically, if you have the maven plugin installed.
